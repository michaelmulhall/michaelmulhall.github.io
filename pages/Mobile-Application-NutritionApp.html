            <h4>The prompt:</h4>
            <h2>On-demand B2B delivery system</h2>
            <p>Imagine it is Valentine’s Day and you own a flower boutique shop. You have 10 times your normal order and not enough employees to deliver them. It makes no sense to hire a full-time delivery driver if you just need them for that day and it’s difficult to find a temporary by-contract driver. This is where TyltGO comes in. TyltGO offers on-demand drivers. Like Uber for business-to-business deliveries. Now you can fulfill the hearts of all the lovebirds on this Valentine’s day without incurring high costs and stress.

                <p>TyltGO’s Customer app serves as a one-stop platform for all types of deliveries (food, alcohol, packages, textbooks, etc.).
<br><br>
                        Although we ended up scrapping the app, I wanted to showcase these as I learned a lot through deconstructing and analyzing what currently exists. Since there are so many shipped and conceptual delivery applications, the research phase was really more like one massive design critique of the general user flow and interface design. Overall, a very fun project.

                    <h3>Exploring the options</h3>
                    <p>Most solutions just have a map and search option. I added a ‘Featured Deliveries’ carousel because it allows users to explore order options with more ease and give suggestions for those that are indecisive (like me). </p>

            <p>My favourite part of this project was designing this screen. I was inspired by apps like including mcDonalds, DoorDash, HelloFresh, UberEats, FanTuan, and plenty of concept designs on Dribbble. Then I was able to fine-tune my designs by receiving criticism from my team.  </p>

            <p>This screen was used to validate that the categorizing style, shadows, and layout style used can be cohesive throughout the entire app. Although there’s a lot going on in the banner, I wanted it to be easy for the user to get a quick overview of the store. </p>

            <h4>Reflection:</h4>
            <h2>Getting over imposter syndrome
            <p>Leading a team of 3 designers was extremely intimidating. I was terrified to show my work and doubted my own skills. To get over this, I started doing the  <a class="highlight" href="dailyUI.html" class="highlight">DailyUI Challenge</a>. I focused on sharpening my visual craft, allowing the pressure and self-doubt to push me to work harder, and let my work speak for itself. </p>
    <br><br>
    </h2><h3>Nothing is ever fully finished</h3>
    <p>Stemming from imposter syndrome, I felt the need for my designs to be absolutely perfect before letting the team see it. I soon began to realize that nothing is ever completely ‘finished’ as there is always room for improvement. I also learned the developers I worked with prefer given consistent small iterations rather than one fully fleshed-out prototype. </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Understanding the audience</h3>
<p>Designing for delivery drivers meant I was designing for a user group that I could not relate with at all. I had to rely on research findings to determine the gap between mine and the users assumptions. For example, Driver screens had simple and concise UI as illustrations and color actually diverts attention, making it more difficult for them to perform the task. </p>
